# Parse Emails

We use [Parse](http://parse.com "Parse") as the backend for our app, and wanted an easy way to import our users' email addresses into [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com "Mail Chimp") so that we can stay in touch.

Parse exports its classes as .json files, so this script parses a .json file and saves it as a .csv that can be imported directly into Mailchimp.

Make sure your .json file is in the same directory as this script if you don't want to have to write in the directory path.
