# Parse Emails

We use [Parse](http://parse.com "Parse") as our backend for our app, and wanted an easy way to import our users' email addresses into [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com "Mail Chimp") so that we can stay in touch.

Parse exports its classes as .json files, so this script parses a JSON file and saves it as a .csv that can be imported directly into Mailchimp.
